![OD during induction](../Images/)

- Choose 4 strains to continue for the reseed that has the least number of ADE+ cells at T=0 and the highest number of ADE+ after induction.
  - Based on background at T=0.
  - Or highest OD at end of induction
  - Start reseed with OD of 0.1. 
  - Incubate at 30C, 120 rpm (START AT 15:00)

- **08062021**
- [] Check ADE+ cells during induction. Counting colonies from each plate. 
  - Image J protocol: 
    1. select image of interest: circle tool and edit-> clear outside (clear so that just all text is removed)
    2. Image ->  Type -> 16bits
    3. Make sure to capture the maximum number of right colonies: Image -> Adjust -> Threshold . Make sure the colonies are all red.
    4. Process -> Make binary-> Watershed
    5. Analyse ->  Analyse Particles, select minimum size of 2 pixels   (?)

- [] Plate 200ul with 1000X dilution in SD-Ade , and 200ul with 40000X dilution in SD-ura to estimate the growth of ade+cells compared with the T=0 of reseeding. Expect  that the ade+ cells have grown by a factor of ~1000x. 

- End of reseeding after ~90? hours (END AT 11:00)
- [] Harvest of the cell culture.
  - Centrifuge 1L for 20 min at 4500rpm
  - Move pellet to 50ml centrifuge tube
  - Centrifuge 10 min at 3000rpm
