# Transformation protocol (P.24 High Efficiency Tranformation of Yeast v 1.0)

Check cell concentration of liquid colonies with nanodrop
Incubate for 4 hours (step 4 of transformation protocol)

5: ~8.5 ml culture in 10ml tubes. Centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes
6: pour off the medium, resuspend in 10 ml H20 (by vortexing) and centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes.
7: pour off the H20, resuspend cells in 1.0 ml of 0.1M lithium acetat (LiAc). Transfer suspension to epi cup.
8: Centrifuge for 5 seconds and 8000g, remove LiAc with pipette
9: resuspend to 100uL: Add 80 LiAc (mix by pipetting)
10: boil (98C) 1.0ml of carrier DNA for 5 min and put on ice
11: vortex cell suspension, pipette 50 uL (10?) into epi tubes. Centrifuge at 8000g for 5 seconds and remove LiAc with micropipette
12: Add to pellet in order:
| amount         | Type           |
|----------------|----------------|
| 240 uL         | PEG            |
| 36 uL          | 1.0M LiAc      |
| 25 uL          | ss carrier DNA |
| 50 uL          | H2O+plasmid DNA|

13: vortex until mixed
14: incubate at 30C for 30 min
15: heat shock at 42C for 30min in water bath
16: centrifuge at 8000rpm for 15 seconds. Remove liquid with pipette.
17: pipette 1ml YPD into each tube. Resuspend by pipetting up and down gently. Incubate 1-2 hours at 30C
18: plate out the entire amount onto prepared selective plates
19: incubate at 30C for 3 days
